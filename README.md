# RE-INSTALLING APPS AFTER A FRESH INSTALL ... EFFICIENTLY üëç

#### Usage

The macOS and the Ubuntu directories have an install.command and install.sh file,
respectively. To use them, simply clone the repo and run the install scripts from the terminal.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/bootstrap.git
```

The scripts are built around lists of applications ( in `<application>.txt` files),
which one can easily customize (add, delete apps to your liking).
With somewhat a lack of imagination on my part, I hope the names given to the
<application>.txt files are self-explanatory.

Be sure to check out the resources directory while you are at it! There might be convenience scripts in there that could come in handy as well.
