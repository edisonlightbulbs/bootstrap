# RE-INSTALLING APPS AFTER A FRESH INSTALL ... with a little less effort üëç

#### Usage

The macOS and the Ubuntu directories have an install.command and install.sh file,
respectively. To use them, simply clone the repo and run the install scripts from the terminal.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/bootstrap.git
```

The scripts are built around lists of applications where one can easily add or delete apps.
With somewhat a lack of imagination on my part, the names of wach application list should 
pretty much give away what **type** of application goes to **which application list**.
   
   ```
   apt.txt
   snap.txt
   
   brew.txt
   brew_cask.txt
   ```

Be sure to check out the resources directory while you are at it! There might be more goodness in there that could come in handy as well.
