## exa development tools

These scripts deal with things like packaging release-worthy versions of exa and making sure the published versions actually work.

They are **not general-purpose scripts** that you’re able to run from your main computer! They’re intended to be run from the Vagrant machines — they have commands such as ‘package-exa’ or ‘check-release’ that execute them instead.
